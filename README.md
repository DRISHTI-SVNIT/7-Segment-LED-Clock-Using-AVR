This project is based on taking input from RTC(REAL TIME CLOCK) IC to the microcontroller and display it on the 7 segment display using 3*8 decoders.RTC also internally calculates the time so  there is no worry if the system is shut down , we'll get the real time once we have configured it even if the system is powered off.
